[list=1]

[*][b]Bolgrif[/b]: Bolgrifs are half-giants living in the frozen highlands of Solasta. They are crafty, cautious, reclusive, distrust most humanoids except elves and prefer to live far from civilization in tight-knit clans. If pressed into battle, bolgrifs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and nature magic.
[*][b]Dark Elf[/b]: Dark elves are descendants of elves that have been changed over time by living in the inhospitable Badlands. Dark elves are largely nocturnal and have become adapted to living in ancient Badlands ruins, especially buried underground ruins. They tend to have dark skin and pale hair.
[*][b]Gnome[/b]: A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
[*][b]Gray Dwarf[/b]: The Gray Dwarves are dwarves who have been changed after only a few generations of exposure to the mysterious magics of the Badlands. They are largely nocturnal and dwell mostly in buried ruins. Their skin color tends toward gray or even coal-black. Unlike most dwarves, they do not grow beards.

[*][b]Half-Sylvan Elf[/b]: Half-Sylvan elves are trained to survive in the wilds and are particularly apt to survival. As their sylvan elf heritage, they are trained to fight with swords and bows since childhood.
[*][b]Kobold[/b]: Kobolds are small reclusive creatures. Recently, some of the more advanced tribes of kobolds have chosen to reveal themselves and interact with other races. It is not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time as the dragonborn making themselves known, as the most advanced kobolds seem to in many ways mimic the dragonborn, even naming themselves in a similar style. They may even be more advanced than other kobolds due to intermingling with the dragonborn.

[*][b]Resonating Strike[/b]: Select one creature within melee range of you and a different creature that you can see within 5 feet of main target. You make a melee attack with current weapon against first creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and resonating sound leaps to second target, dealing thunder damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
At 5th level, the melee attack deals extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the thunder damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th levels.

[*][b]Mirror Image[/b]: Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, each time a creature targets you with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
If you have 3 duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With 2 duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With 1 duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it is Blinded, or has Blindsight, Truesight or Tremorsense (doesn't apply if you don't touch ground).

On a failed save, the creature takes 3d4 slashing damage. As a bonus action, you can move the storm up to 30 feet in any direction.
[*][b]Protect Threshold[/b]: Tracing arcane sigils along its boundary, you can ward a doorway, window, or other portal from entry.

In addition, any enemy creature within 10ft of you when you cast, or that enters or starts its turn in that range has its movement speed lowered by 10ft until start of its next turn.

[*][b]Mass Heal[/b]: A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore 120 hit points each to 6 creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. 
[*][b]Meteor Swarm [Single Target][/b]: Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at a single point you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
[*][b]Power Word Heal[/b]: A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
[*][b]Power Word Kill[/b]: You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

[*][b]Weird[/b]: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
